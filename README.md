Code and explicit examples accompanying the paper "Explicit realisation of elements of Tate-Shafarevich group constructed from Kolyvagin classes".

The file kolyvagin_descent.txt contains the MAGMA code to compute a set of equations defining a genus one curve in P^{p-1} that represents a Kolyvagin class. The input consists of an elliptic curve E, a Heegner discriminant D and a prime p. The code comes with preloaded example E, D and p. The file Heegner_point_code.txt contains the part of the code to compute the Heegner point associated to this data, and the file kolyvagin_class_equations.txt contains the code to compute the equations from the Heegner point. It can be compiled after running  Heegner_point_code.txt. 

The folders 1058d1, 3364c1, 37a1 and 681b3 contain computed examples for the elliptic curves with the corresponding label in Cremona's tables.
