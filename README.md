Code and explicit examples accompanying the paper "Explicit realisation of elements of Tate-Shafarevich group constructed from Kolyvagin classes".

Execute the code by inputting an elliptic curve E, a Heegner discriminant D and a prime p into MAGMA, then running one of either heegner_point_code_original.txt or heegner_point_code_version2.txt. The first one computes the Heegner point z_K, while the other one computes the point Rsigma directly. Depending on situation, one might be faster than the other. To compute the Kolyvagin class, paste the code from kolyvagin_class_minimization.txt.
